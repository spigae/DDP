I have developed a tool for predicting the distance taken to stop a car based on its speed.
The data employed for the prediction is the dataset cars.

For more details about this dataset please visit the following website:

The prediction is calculated assuming a linear relation between the distance taken to stop and the speed of the car.

The files of the applications are:
